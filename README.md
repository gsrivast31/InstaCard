An iOS App to store all your important cards information locally.

## Store all your cards

- Access all your cards information on the go. Store PAN card, Passport, Ration, Voter card numbers as well as your loyalty cards data. No need to carry your cards just for the number.
- All data is stored locally and we do not save any information onto our servers. Trust us.
- Additionally add PIN to prevent other users from accessing information on your phone.

## Add New Cards
Its easy to add new card data. Just add person's name, card number, issued date and expiry date (whatever is applicable to the card). You can additionally capture card's image.

## Export Card details
View your card details. Email them to yourself, export to PDF or print them.

## Tech Stack
The code has been written in Objective-C. Will be migrating it to Swift soon.
Uses CoreData to store information and uses modified version of NSFetchedResultsController to use with UICollectionViewController.
